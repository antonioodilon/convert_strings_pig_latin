# convert_strings_pig_latin
This command-line program in Rust converts strings to Pig Latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the
    word and “ay” is added, so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay”
    added to the end instead (“apple” becomes “apple-hay”).
